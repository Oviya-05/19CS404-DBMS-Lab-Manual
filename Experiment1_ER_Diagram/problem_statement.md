# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## üéØ Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## üìö Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

---

## üß™ Choose One Scenario:

### üîπ Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### üîπ Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## üìù Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

# ER Diagram Submission - Oviya K P

## Scenario Chosen:
University
The ER diagram models a university‚Äôs information system, focusing on students, their login credentials, course enrollments, college details, and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) integration.

## Entities and Attributes:
1. Student
Attributes:
   - First Name, Last Name: Basic personal identification.
   - (Name): Composite attribute combining First and Last Name.
   - Age: Optional (dashed line), possibly derived from Date of Birth.
   - Date of Birth: For age calculation and identification.
   - Address: Student‚Äôs residential information
   - Email: For communication and login.
   - Phone: Contact number.

2. Login
Attributes:
   - Register Number: Unique identifier for login.
   - Email ID: Used for login and communication.
   - Password: For authentication.
       
3. Courses
Attributes:
   - Course Name: Name of the course.
   - Course Code: Unique code for each course.
   - Department: Department offering the course.
   - (Staff): Composite attribute for staff details:
   - Phone: Staff contact.
   - Faculty Name: Name of the instructor.
   - Teacher ID: Unique staff identifier.

4. College
Attributes:
   - College Name: Name of the college.
   - College Code: Unique college identifier.

5. ERP
No explicit attributes shown, represents the university‚Äôs ERP system.
...

## Relationships and Constraints:
1. Student - Login (Has)
   - Cardinality: One-to-one (each student has one login).
   - Participation: Total (every student must have a login).

2. Login - Courses (Enroll)
   - Cardinality: Many-to-many (a login can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple logins).
   - Participation: Partial (not every login must enroll in a course, and vice versa).

3. Courses - College (Has)
   - Cardinality: Many-to-one (many courses belong to one college).
   - Participation: Total (every course must belong to a college).

4. College - ERP (Has)
   - Cardinality: One-to-one (each college has one ERP).
   - Participation: Total (every college is linked to an ERP).
...

## Extension (Prerequisite / Billing):
   - Each course may have implicit prerequisites defined in its metadata (not shown explicitly in this diagram).
   
   - Students enrolling in courses assume they meet any prerequisites set by the college or department.

## Design Choices:
- Entities:
The chosen entities (Student, Login, Courses, College, ERP) reflect core components of a university system, ensuring all essential information is captured.
- Attributes:
Attributes are selected to uniquely identify and describe each entity. Composite attributes like Name and Staff allow for grouping related details.
- Relationships:
Relationships are designed to mirror real-world associations: students have logins, logins enroll in courses, courses belong to colleges, and colleges use ERP systems.
- Assumptions:
   Each student has exactly one login.
   A login is required to enroll in courses.
   Courses are always associated with a college.
   ERP is unique per college.
   Staff is modeled as a composite attribute within Courses for simplicity.
  
## RESULT
  The ER diagram models a university system where each student has personal details and a unique login, can enroll in multiple courses (each managed by staff), and is associated with a college that uses an ERP system. Key relationships include students having logins, logins enrolling in courses, courses belonging to colleges, and colleges using ERP. The design captures essential academic and administrative data flow within a university.
